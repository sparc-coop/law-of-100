# Introduction 
Make or break a habit, one day at a time.
Doing something 100 times can form new habits or break old ones. Law of 100 helps you choose, track and share your 100-day progress.

You may have noticed a lot of “100-day” challenges on the internet. That is because taking repetitive action towards a goal helps 
you better achieve it, and 100 seems to be the magical number. After those first 100 days, many people find it becomes routine, 
and they keep doing it out of pure habit.

Don’t believe me? Check out [this study](https://jamesclear.com/repetitions) by Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida.
